# 📊 SQL Sales Analysis Project

A SQL project to analyze sales data using structured queries and relational database design.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of SQL through real-world business questions, data modeling, and query writing. It is designed for learners like me who want to practice working with sales data and uncover business insights using SQL.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** – For writing and running SQL queries  
- **GitHub** – For hosting and sharing the project  
- *(Note: All data was manually inserted using SQL queries — no CSV import was done)*

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The project includes 3 main tables:

- **`orders`** – Customer, city, region, and order details  
- **`products`** – Product categories  
- **`order_details`** – Sales, quantity, and profit for each product in an order  

Relational keys were used to connect the tables properly.
